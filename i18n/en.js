        "Paragraph-line-3-6": "The prohibitively expensive collateral damage from blocking every connection will propel censors to let go what appears compliant. Hence our collateral freedom.",
        "Tab-4": "Do you offer unlimited traffic plans?",
        "Paragraph-line-4-1": "None of our plans have a fixed bandwidth limit. However, speeds are throttled after varying amounts of usage.",
        "Paragraph-line-4-2": "Our 3 plans have 50GB, 100GB, and 200GB bandwidth with uncapped speeds. When monthly usages exceed such thresholds, speeds are capped at 10M, 20M, and 30M respectively, until usage resets.",
        "Paragraph-line-4-3": "We believe our pricing structure is fair and balanced. Uncapped and unthrottled plans distort prices and invite abuses. Bit torrent downloaders, for example, pay the same price as you do, but eat up a distortional share of resources and slow down your connection. In effect, average users pay for abusers.",

        "Paragraph-line-5-2": "Any modern computing device you can think of, we most likely have that covered. Thanks to the multiple open-source and proprietary protocols we support, we are confident that you can easily connect to VPN network on almost any device you choose.",
        "Paragraph-line-5-3": "For personal computers run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, multiple clients can help you secure your internet; for mobile gadgets running iOS and Android, a plethora of apps work like a breeze; better yet, for open source router platforms such as OpenWRT, Tomato, and Asus Merlin, connecting to UnPanel is just one plugin install away.",
        "Tab-6": "What payment methods do you accept?",
        "Paragraph-line-6-1": "We accept major credit cards issued all over the world. The list includes Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, and China UnionPay.",
        "Paragraph-line-6-2": "For customers from China, our Alipay (Zhifubao) integration simplifies the payment process to a OR code scan, costing you mere seconds.",
        "Paragraph-line-6-3": "Subscribers from the rest of the world served by PayPal, we have taken care of your payment too.",

        "Tab-7": "Do you keep logs of my internet traffic?",

The log entries include time, source address, destination address, and the amount of traffic. We do not monitor your internet traffic in real time, but we do conduct after-fact reviews.
